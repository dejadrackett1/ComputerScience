                                                Laertes falls
  Laer here Hamlet Hamlet thou art slain

  Hamlet Heaven make thee free follow thee
    dead Horatio Wretched queen adieu

    strict arrest O could tell 
    let Horatio dead
    Thou liv'st report  cause aright
    unsatisfied
  Hor Never believe it
    more an antique Roman than Dane
    Here's yet some liquor left
  Hamlet As th'art man
    Give cup Let go  heaven ha't
    O good Horatio what wounded name
    Things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
    thou didst ever hold thy heart
    Absent thee felicity awhile

  Osr  ng Fortinbras conquest come Poland
    ambassadors England gives
    warlike volley
  Hamlet O die Horatio
    potent poison quite o'ercrows  spirit
    cannot live hear news England

    Which solicited  rest silence             Dies
  Hor cracks noble heart Good night sweet prince
    flights angels sing thee thy rest

  Fort quarry cries havoc O proud Death
    What feast thine eternal cell
    thou many princes shot
    bloodily hast struck
  Ambassador sight dismal
    our affairs England come too late
    ears senseless should give us hearing
    tell commandment fulfill'd
    Rosencrantz Guildenstern dead
    Where should our thanks
  Hor mouth
    Had  ability life thank  
    never gave commandment their death
    since jump upon bloody question
    Polack wars England
    here arriv'd give order these bodies
    High stage placed view
    let speak yet unknowing world
    How these things came shall hear
    carnal bloody unnatural acts
    accidental judgments casual slaughters

    Fall'n  inventors' heads I
    Truly deliver
  Fort Let us haste hear it
    call noblest audience

    Which claim  vantage doth invite me
  Hor shall al cause speak
    mouth whose voice will draw more

    Even while men's minds wild lest more mischance
    plots errors happen
  Fort Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like soldier stage

    Take bodies Such sight as this
    Becomes field here shows much amiss
    Go bid soldiers shoot
            Exeunt marching   which peal ordnance
                                                   shot off
