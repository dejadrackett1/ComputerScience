  ancient grudge break new mutiny 
  civil blood makes civil hands unclean 
  forth  fatal loins these   foes
 pair star crossed lovers take their life 
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Doth  their death bury their parents' strife

ROMEO
 bed asleep while they dream things true 

MERCUTIO
O  see Queen Mab hath been   
  fairies' midwife  comes
 shape  bigger than an agate stone
On  forefinger an alderman 
Drawn   team little atomi
Over men's noses as they lie asleep 
Her wagon spokes made long spinners' legs 
 cover  wings grasshoppers 
Her traces  smallest spider web 
Her collars  moonshine's wat'ry beams 
Her whip cricket's bone  lash film 
Her wagoner  small gray coated gnat 
  half  big as  round little worm
Pricked  lazy finger  maid 
Her chariot an empty hazelnut 
Made  joiner squirrel or old grub 
Time out o' mind  fairies' coachmakers 
  this state  gallops night night
Through lovers' brains they dream love 
On courtiers' knees  dream cur'sies straight 
O'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream fees 
O'er ladies' lips who straight kisses dream 
Which oft  angry Mab  blisters plagues
Because their breaths  sweetmeats tainted are 
Sometime  gallops o'er  courtier's nose 
 dreams he smelling out  su 
 sometime comes    ti pig's tail 
Tickling  parson's nose as he lies asleep 
Then he dreams a benefice 
Sometime  driveth o'er  soldier's neck 
 dreams he cutting foreign throats 
Of breaches ambuscadoes Spanish blades 
Of healths five fathom deep anon
Drums  his ear which he starts wakes
 being thus frighted swears  prayer or  
 sleeps aga  This  very Mab
 plats  manes horses   night
 bakes  elflocks  foul sluttish hairs 
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes 
This  hag when maids lie their backs 
 presses  learns  first bear 
Making  women good carriage 
This   

ROMEO  Peace peace Mercutio peace 
Thou talk'st  hing 

MERCUTIO  True  talk dreams 
Which are  children an idle bra 
Begot  hing  va fantasy 
Which as th substance as  air
 more inconstant than  wind who woos
Even  frozen bosom  north
 being angered puffs away thence 
Turning his side  dew dropping south 

BENVOLIO
This wind  talk blows us ourselves 
Supper done shall come too late 

ROMEO
 fear too early  mind misgives
 consequence yet hanging   stars
Shall bitterly beg his fearful date
 this night's revels expire  term
Of  despised life closed   breast

Direct  sail  lusty gentlemen

Alike bewitched  charm looks

  steal love's sweet ba fearful hooks 
Being held  foe he may   have access
To brea such vows as lovers use swear

To meet new beloved any

Check'ring  eastern clouds  streaks light 
 fleckled darkness like  drunkard reels
  forth day's path Titan's fiery wheels 
Now ere  sun advance his burning eye 
 day cheer night's dank dew dry 
 must upfill this osier cage ours
 baleful weeds precious juiced flowers 
 Earth that's nature's mother tomb 
What burying grave  womb 
 womb children divers kind
We sucking natural bosom find 
Many many virtues excellent 
None   yet all different 
O mickle  powerful grace  lies
 plants herbs stones their true qualities 
For naught  vile   Earth doth live
  Earth  special good doth give 
Nor aught  good  strained  fair use 
Revolts true birth stumbling abuse 
Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied 
 vice sometime action dignified

Is Rosaline  thou didst love  dear

How much salt water thrown away  waste
To season love   doth   taste 
 sun   yet thy sighs heaven clears 
Thy old groans yet ringing  mine ancient ears 
Lo here upon thy cheek  sta doth sit
Of an old tear    washed  yet 
 e'er thou wast thyself these woes thine

Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow

Since arm arm  voice doth us affray 
Hunting thee hence  hunt's   day 
O begone  More light light  grows

Lifts   ground  cheerful thoughts

 Strange dream  gives  dead man leave to

 breathed such life  kisses   lips
  revived was an emperor 
Ah how sweet love itself possessed
When  love's shadows are  rich  joy
